# Captains Log

I am the captain of the vessel that is my body, and this is my log. I have come here to chew bubblegum and to make things more accessible. And Iâ€™m all out of bubblegum.

Goal: Be open and honest about my experience as a human and a professional. Normalize the reality that there is a human on the other side of every keyboard and that every human has a unique story to tell.
