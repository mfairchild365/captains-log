# 2021 Retrospective

TLDR; I grew as a leader and a coach while caring for my lovely and amazing family and all of their health problems.

My goal with these retrospectives is to be radically open and honest about my experience as a human and a professional. Normalize the reality that there is a human on the other side of every keyboard and that every human has a unique story to tell.

## A picture of my personal life in 2021

My life is largely defined by my family. As anyone with young children knows, the kids tend to dominate your time. My youngest daughter turned 14 months old. My other daughter turned 5 years old. When not caring for them, I'm playing with them. When not playing with them, I'm spending quality time with my wife. Otherwise, I'm working, caring for my aging dad, attempting to squeeze in a bit of work on my side projects, or trying to relax by playing video games or reading. 

### What I read

- Several of the Expanse books (5/5)

### The year of illness
I can't talk about 2021 without talking about this defining aspect.

As the pandemic raged around us, different illnesses ravaged our lives. Our youngest child was born at the end of 2020. Labor was induced early because imagining showed that she had an enlarged kidney. The initial diagnosis and prognosis were not good. As a father, having that concern weigh on your shoulders is difficult. As a professional worry-wart, that concern can be crushing. But more accurate imagining and testing were done in 2021 and the diagnosis and prognosis were revised and much better. Throughout the year continued tests show that she is improving and that the issue will likely resolve itself with time, without the need for surgical intervention.

My wife has Crohn's disease and was on very powerful immunosuppressants for it. Throughout the pregnancy, she dealt with high temperatures (but not quite fevers). Very unusual for her, but everyone thought it was just the pregnancy. After birth, the high temperatures started to turn into fevers. She started to get pain in her abdomen. By March, she was unable to work, unable to get out of bed. Her specialists did tests and imagining, and kept telling her that it was just a bad Crohn's flare. They prescribed pain medicine and more immunosuppressants. Those didn't work. It kept getting worse. Because of the fevers and pandemic, it was difficult for her to see her doctors. Wait times were absurd - scheduling multiple weeks out. Emergency Room doctors didn't do anything. I felt helpless. All I wanted to do was help her. She could no longer breastfeed our baby and I transitioned her to formula. The fever is now at 106.

At around 2 am on Easter morning, I awoke to a loud thunk. I noticed that my wife was no longer in the bed. I got up to find her and noticed the bathroom door was closed. I knocked and asked if everything was okay… no response. I tried again… no response. I open the door and find her passed out on the floor surrounded by blood. A 911 call later and she is admitted to the hospital. 

I stopped counting the blood transfusions at 20. They couldn't stop the bleeding. It wasn't Crohn's. It was a rare fungal infection called Histoplasmosis which had spread to multiple organs. They couldn't keep up with the blood loss. The only thing they could try was to take out her large colon. They did. Afterward, the surgeons took me into a confidential, soundproofed, room and told me that they had never seen anything like this before. Lacerations all over her small intestine, too many to count. They can't take out the small intestine. She is already missing some from past resections related to Crohn's. They told me the bleeding will likely continue. The chances of her surviving are slim to none. I cried. Right there in front of the surgeons. And got real comfortable with my faith.

I stopped counting the days in the hospital at 30. Doctors, nurses, and hospital staff became so familiar with me that they waved at me in the halls and some even texted me, even if I hadn't seen them in weeks. A security guard thought I worked there. The bleeding slowed and eventually stopped. My wife now has an ileostomy, and her small intestines empty into a pouch on the side of her body. She has struggled with nutrition and high output. She can't absorb any formulation (liquid or pill) of the ideal anti-fungal medication for her illness. She has to have daily IV treatments for a full year if not longer. I watch the weekly lab tests impatiently waiting for her levels to become normal. Because of the emergency nature of the surgery, the placement of the ileostomy is not optimal, and she has struggled with leaks and frequent changes. She can't get it revised until the infection is gone. Hopefully sometime this year. Seeing her emotional and physical pain crushes me. But she is strong. She will continue to recover. And I'll be here to help her. I'm so grateful that she is back home and feeling so much better.

This has been one of the most difficult seasons in my life. I pray that the season ends soon. I'm also thankful that we have good health insurance. But boy do I think that health care in America is broken.

I've been working with a therapist to help process and deal with the trauma of all of this. I think it's one of the best decisions I've made all year. I'm also thankful for all of the love, care, and help from family, friends, and co-workers. I don't know what I would have done without y'all. I'm also very grateful for how gracious Deque was as an employer when this was happening.

I have a kid under age five with kidney problems who can't get the covid vaccine. I have a wife that nearly died from being immunocompromised and is still recovering. I have no patience for pandemic misinformation, anti-vaxxers, or anti-maskers. You might think that your decisions only affect you, but they don't. They affect the rest of us.  I'm not driven by "fear." I'm driven by love and by science.

## A picture of my professional life in 2021

I work in the field of digital accessibility or helping others make software that works for people with disabilities. This is a passion of mine, and I sometimes struggle with balancing my work with my personal life. The work is difficult but very rewarding and meaningful. I learn constantly, and as a human, I make mistakes too. I have a lot of accomplishments listed here, but none of it would have been possible without my wonderful clients, co-workers, and other accessibility professionals.

- I became the "Coach of Coaches" for a client at Deque. In this role, I have coached around 20 accessibility coaches. It's basically a fancy name for a lead coach.
- I coined the Accessibility Behavior Informed Development (a11yBID) agile software development process and wrote about it in the [Collaborative planning, the forgotten step of accessible development](https://www.deque.com/blog/collaborative-planning-the-forgotten-step-of-accessible-development/) blog post. It has proven to be highly effective. I'll also be speaking about this at Deque's axe-con in 2022!
- I wrote a playbook for how to approach accessibility coaching.
- I graduated a development crew from the accessibility coaching program (while balancing my role as a lead coach).
- I co-chaired the [W3C ARIA-AT community group](https://aria-at.w3.org/) and helped make great progress on automating screen readers for testing purposes.
- I published several updates to [a11ysupport.io](http://a11ysupport.io), including new features, tests, and expectations. I also got several contributions!
- I created an [accessible jeopardy prototype](https://codepen.io/mfairchild365/pen/XWjLEve).
- I was invited to lecture at the University of Nebraska about digital accessibility!
- I co-ran the Nebraska Digital Accessibility Meetup.
- I contribued [code fixes to NVDA](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/pulls?q=+is%3Apr+author%3Amfairchild365+).
- I'm seeing myself become more of a leader. This is a new direction for me, and one that I think is promising. 

## What I think I'm doing well

- Caring for my family
- Making sure I have a small amount of time just for me (although I could do better)
- Advocating for myself, my family members, and the folks around me
- Advocating for digital accessibility
- Accessibility Coaching
- Being a leader (but not a boss)
- Continuous learning
- Contributing back to the larger digital accessibility space

## What I could be doing better

This wouldn't be a retrospective if I didn't try to identify areas where I can improve.

- Listen better. Ask more questions than provide answers. Celebrate other people's accomplishments. I feel like I do a good job of these things already, but there is certainly room to improve.
- Explore my faith more.
- Make more time for me and better balance work and personal time. For example, carve out time for lunch.
- Form healthier habits - from eating to exercising.
- Delegate responsibility and trust others to excel
